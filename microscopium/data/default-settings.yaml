# The first phase is a feature computation from images specified in a csv file.
# Input csv files should have one row per input image and minimally three
# columns:
#   - an *index* column containing a unique identifier for each image.
#   - a *url* column containing the path to each image (can be absolute or
#     relative to the csv file path).
#   - a *replicate* column containing an identifier for each replicate, meaning
#     images having received identical treatment.
#   - optionally, *group* columns containing arbitrary groupings of samples.
#     These will be used to color points in the plot and produce an interactive
#     legend, so there should not be too many categories in any group.

  # Features produced by feature computation can be reduced to 2D for display
  # as a scatter-plot. This is done with the below classes, which must follow
  # the scikit-learn unsupervised `fit`/`fit_transform` API. The 0th component
  # will map to x, and the 1st to y, and both will be placed in the
  # corresponding column in the output.
